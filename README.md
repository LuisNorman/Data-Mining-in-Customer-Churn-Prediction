# Data-Mining-in-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Data mining in customer churn prediction can be vital to a company's success. In this tutorial, I extracted a company's customer dataset that provides information on geographical region, age, salary, exited, gender, credit score, and balance of the customer. 

In tableau, I applied data mining to this company's dataset to analyze who and/or why customer's are leaving - a very important insight for businesses. Tableau was used for it's illustrative and easy to understand graphs.

# System Requirements
1. Tableau 


# How to Run
To get started, download the dataset file, Churn-Modeling.xlsx and tableu workbook, Data Mining - Customer Churn. From there, you will see illustrative visualizations of feature comparisons in respect to customer's exiting or not. By analyzing the charts/graphs you can now make assumptions of possible reason that cause customer churn.
